Title: A toolkit for processing and manipulating data contained in FCS files.
Version: 0.99.1
Author: Tyler J Burns
Maintainer: Tyler J Burns <burns.tyler@gmail.com>
Description: This package reads in fcs files as input. The primary goal is to
    prepare these files for R-based manipulations, like unsupervised learning. 
    This includes converting the files into data matricies with markers of
    interest, transformations, and normalizations. Included are functions to 
    output these matricies as csv files and fcs files.
